# sentiment-api

A web application with a Flask backend and React frontend where users can find the number of positive and negative recent tweets for a given keyword. 

These tweets are retrieved using the Twitter Api and Tweepy and are cleaned in the back-end.

This sentiment analysis model was made using SKlearn and is a Naive Bayes model and the back-end and front-end are hosted on Heroku.
